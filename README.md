# SparseGraph

Sparse graph implementation for Unity with C#. It includes graph and directed graph impelementations with
adjacency list representation.

I am using it in Unity, but except ErrorPrinter class and Vector2 memmber in NavGraphNode class, there is no
Unity dependency.

It is under the WTFPL (http://www.wtfpl.net/) license. So, you can do whatever you like with the source code.
But, it would be cool if you mention me, and let me know if you use it.

PS If you can use higher level of C# in your project, do not forget to add in parameter modifier. Unity did not let me.
